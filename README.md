# Compositional Pattern Producing Network

Inspired by [PicBreeder](http://picbreeder.org), but instead of using genetic algorithms, allows the user to interact with the network and purposly create patterns by composing math functions.

1. Press any key to add a random node
2. click and drag from one node to another to create a connection
3. ctrl + drag on a node to move it
4. alt + click no a node to delete it
 
The inputs to the graph are the X and Y positions on the canvas. The outputs are the RGB values that will render to the canvas.
